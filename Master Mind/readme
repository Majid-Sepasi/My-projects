Mastermind board games have a row of holes set apart at one end of the board, hidden from view under a hinged shield.
The person who plays the code maker secretly takes a few colored pegs and places them in that row of holes,
in any order. This is the code that the codebreaker will try to guess.
in this project, we assumed that colors are numeric digits and there is a single player only.
